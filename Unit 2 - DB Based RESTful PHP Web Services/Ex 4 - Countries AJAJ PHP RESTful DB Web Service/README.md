# CIS 266 – Web Services Unit 2 Lesson Plan 4 – Countries AJAJ/PHP RESTful DB Web Service

### Objectives: 
-	Continue basic understanding of developing AJAJ/PHP RESTful DB web services
-	Students create a new AJAJ/PHP DB RESTful Web Service relating to countries of the world

## Lab Assignment: Unit2_Ex4 (AJAJ/PHP RESTful DB Web Service for countries of the world):
1.	Create a new website folder in your CIS266\Students folder named lstf_unit2_ex4. 

2.	Create a new MySQL database table named lstf_countries in a database named “students” with at least 5 columns/fields relating to 
countries, populate the table with at least 5 records relating to individual countries of the world.

3.	Develop an OOP based AJAJ/PHP RESTful Web Service & class/service testers for your lstf_countries table with a structure and 
functions equivalent to your Unit2_Ex3 Web Service.

4.	Create an index.html page in your lstf_unit2_ex4 folder that allows the user to either run testers and/or your web services which 
allows the user to display all the records and/or to select and display a single record in your lstf_countries table using innerHTML. 
Note that your links should be patterned after the ones provided in the MurachDB_Sample3 folder.

5.	Test that your web service is fully functional (testers and the HTML/JS IO operations) & then capture sufficient inputs/outputs to 
demonstrate both the testers & web services work properly and/or report errors (note you do NOT have to include error codes, just a 
simple error report at the Web Service Client level) and paste the captures into a new Microsoft Word document and save the document 
as an industry standard .pdf document named LstF_Unit2_Ex4.pdf. Make sure to include the address bar in your captures!
