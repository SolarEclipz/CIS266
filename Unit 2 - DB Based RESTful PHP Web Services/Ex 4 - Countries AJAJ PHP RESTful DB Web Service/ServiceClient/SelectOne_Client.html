	var aID = $('#rowID').val();
					
	$.ajax({
		type: 'POST',
		url: '../ServiceProvider/StudentDB_API.php',
		data: 'rowID=' + aID, // This part can be confusing. 
    /*
      rowID= is doing one of a few things. First, rowID is the textbox's ID. This then gets passed
      to ../serviceprovider/studentdb_api.php
      From there the studentdb_api is REQUESTING 'rowID', which inputs what ever the person put in to search 
      in the DB for that country. This can be seen when debugging studentdb_api.php you get a return value
      of studentdb_api.php?rowID=
      
      So appending + aID, which is equal to the textsboxs #rowID, (in this case its finding the ID of a row) it returns
      studentdb_api.php?rowID=1
      
      This returns the first row from the tableName you have selected it to use from the studentDB. 
      
      ***NOTE**** 
      If rowID is not set corrently, (which is super easy to do and I actually failed u2x3 because I was lost) 
      nothing will display on the page. This can be very time consuming trying to track down WHY nothing is displaying.
      
      If your results are not displaying, its more than likley there is an issue with the data: field (in my case rowID)
      
      As you will notice rowID is actually being used in three different files for this exercise to make everything work properly. 
      Because of this, again, is why i spent so much time in u2e3 with nothing to show for it.
