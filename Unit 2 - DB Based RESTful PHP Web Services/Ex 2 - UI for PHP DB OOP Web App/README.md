# CIS 266 – Web Services Unit 2 Lesson 2 – UI for PHP DB OOP Web App
### Objectives: 
•	Developing web user interfaces (UI’s) for OOP DB web applications
•	Students add a UI and selectOne( ) function to their OOP PHP DB code from Unit2_Ex1
•	Students add links to their index.html page to allow users to either display all records/a single record/run testers

## Lab Assignment: Unit2_Ex2 ( UI / HTML Form IO Web Application ):

1.	Create a new website folder in your CIS266\Students folder named lstf_unit2_ex2 and copy/paste all your files from your lstf_unit2_ex1 website into your new website folder. 
2.	Test that your from unit2_ex1 works in your new folder & then add a new function named selectOne( ) to your php class that receives an id/primary key code and returns either a record with the correct primary key or a null value or an error code.
3.	Add a function call to your tester that tests/displays the result of calling your new selectOne( ) function.
4.	After testing that all your class functions work, including your new selectOne( ) function, 
a.	create an html form named DisplayOne.html that allows the user to choose a record to display using any UI selection process you prefer
b.	have the form send the user specified record id to a php file that performs all the necessary operations to recover & display the requested record from the DB table and/or report an error to the user using an OOP approach.
5.	Update your index.html page in your lstf_unit2_ex2 folder that allows the user to either
	  - Display All Records
	   - Display a Single Record
	   - Or Run all of the testers from Unit2_Ex1 & Unit2_Ex2 using simple Web Apps (no JavaScript/AJAX code).
6.	Test that your Web Application is fully functional (the testers and the Web App HTML form IO operations) & then capture sufficient inputs/outputs to demonstrate they all work properly and/or report errors properly and paste the captures into a new Microsoft Word document and save the document as an industry standard .pdf document named LstF_Unit2_2.pdf. Make sure to include the address bar in your captures!

7.	Export your MySQL table as a .sql file named lstf_unit2_ex2.sql.
