# CIS 266 – Web Services Unit 2 Lesson Plan 3 – AJAJ/PHP RESTful DB Web Service
### Objectives: 
•	Continue developing a basic understanding of AJAJ/PHP RESTful DB web services programming
•	Students convert their Unit2_Ex2 Web App to a AJAJ/PHP RESTful Web Service

## Lab Assignment: Unit2_Ex3 (AJAJ/PHP RESTful DB Web Service):
1.	Create a new website folder in your CIS266\Students folder named lstf_unit2_ex3 and copy/paste all your files from your 
lstf_unit2_ex2 website into your new website folder. 
2.	Test that your code from lstf_unit2_ex2 works in your new folder & then add subfolders named ServiceClient & ServiceProvider to 
your new folder and store your class(es) in a class_lib subfolder of your ServiceProvider folder.
3.	Convert your Web App in your new unit2_ex3 folder to an AJAJ/PHP web service with testers similar in structure & function to those 
in the MurachDB_Sample3 folder.
4.	Add links to your index.html page in your lstf_unit2_ex3 folder that allow the user to either:
    -	Run your web service testers 
    -	Run your web service that allows the user to select & display a single record using innerHTML
    -	Run your web service that allows the user to display all records using innerHTML
    -	The links should be modeled after those in the MurachDB_Sample3 folder
5.	Test that your web service is fully functional (testers and the HTML/JS IO operations) & then capture sufficient inputs/outputs 
to demonstrate they work properly and/or report errors properly and paste the captures into a new Microsoft Word document and save 
the document as an industry standard .pdf document named LstF_Unit2_Ex3.pdf. Make sure to include the address bar in your captures!

6.	Export your MySQL table as a .sql file named lstf_unit2_ex3.sql.
