# Unit 1 Lesson 1 – Overview of Web Services & RESTful AJAJ-PHP Service

#### Objectives: 
- Understand basic concepts, approaches and technologies related to Web Services
-	Understand differences between Web Applications & Web Services
-	Students modify sample hello_world code & submit their own simple AJAJ/PHP RESTful Web Service

## Lab Assignment: Unit1_Ex1 (Hello World RESTful AJAJ/PHP Web Service):
1.	Create a folder named CIS266 in your document folder of your Apache server (i.e., the path to your CIS266 local web server folder should look like this:  C:\wamp64\www\CIS266)

2.	Create a subfolder named RESTful in your CIS266 folder (i.e., the path to your new RESTful folder should look like this:  C:\wamp64\www\CIS266\RESTful)

3.	Download the hello_world_v1.zip file from the Unit1 section of CIS266 Handouts

4.	Unzip hello_world_v1 and copy / paste the folder from the .zip folder into your local Apache’s new CIS266\RESTful folder

5.	Test the links at the index.html page in your new folder work properly & then analyze the sample code until you fully understand the testers & the JavaScript Web Service client app (AJAJ app) that accesses the PHP Web Service provider API, converts the JSON message returned, & displays the converted text as innerHTML on the HTML form.

6.	Create a subfolder of your RESTful folder named LstF_Unit1_Ex1 (where Lst is the first three initials of your last name & F is the first initial of your first name), i.e., your new folder name should be: C:\wamp64\www\CIS266\RESTful\LstF_Unit1_Ex1

7.	Copy / Paste the hello_world_v1 folder’s files & subfolders from CIS266\RESTful\hello_world_v1 folder into your new CIS266\RESTful\LstF_Unit1_Ex1 folder and modify the code so that ALL the HTML pages include your full name & Unit 1 Ex1

8.	Fully test that your new links/apps function properly & then capture sufficient inputs (with data entered BEFORE clicking on submit) & related outputs (after clicking on submit) to demonstrate that all links work properly and paste them into a new Microsoft Word document and then save the document as an industry standard .pdf document named LstF_Unit1_Ex1.pdf. Make sure to include the address bar in your captures!

9.	Submit your LstF_Unit1_Ex1.pdf file
