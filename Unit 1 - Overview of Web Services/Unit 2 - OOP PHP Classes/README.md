# Unit 1 Lesson 2 – OOP PHP Classes
### Objectives: 
-	Understand basic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using PHP
-	Students modify sample unit1_ex2 code & submit their own PHP classes & testers

## Lab Assignment: Unit1_Ex2 (OOP / PHP Classes & Testers):
1.	Download the cis266_unit1_ex2.zip file from the Unit1 section of CIS266 Handouts
2.	Unzip cis266_unit1_ex2.zip and copy / paste the unit1_ex2 folder from the unzipped sample folder into your Apache’s CIS266\RESTful folder
3.	Test the links at localhost:8000/CIS266/RESTful/unit1_ex2 work properly & then analyze the sample code until you fully understand the PHP classes and testers & the JavaScript Web Service client app that accesses the PHP Web Service provider API using its endpoint URL & converts the JSON message returned to text and displays the converted text as innerHTML on the HTML form.
4.	Create a folder named Students in your Apache’s CIS266 folder & a subfolder in it named LstF_Unit1_Ex2 (i.e., the path must be:  C:\wamp64\www\CIS266\Students\LstF_Unit1_Ex2)
5.	Copy / Paste unit1_ex2 folder’s files & subfolders into your new CIS266\Students\LstF_Unit1_Ex2 folder and modify the code so that all the links/apps work properly in your new directory
6.	Add a class property named publisher to your Product class and add/modify all PHP functions in both the Product class and the Product_API code to also process this property.
7.	Modify your Web Service Client to also display the new property returned by the web service provider as innerHTML along with all the other service provider data displayed.

8.	Fully test that your new links/apps function & then capture sufficient inputs/outputs to demonstrate they work properly and paste them into a new Microsoft Word document and save the document as an industry standard .pdf document named LstF_Unit1_Ex2.pdf. Make sure to include the address bar in your captures!

9.	Zip up your LstF_Unit1_Ex2 folder into a file named LstF_Unit1_Ex2.zip and submit your .pdf file AND your .zip file as TWO SEPARATE FILES
