# Unit 1 Lesson 3 - DB Emulator RESTful AJAX/PHP Web Service
### Objectives: 
-	Understand Database Emulator approach to develop web services prior to DB implementation
-	Students modify sample unit1_ex3 code & submit their own DB emulator classes/testers/web service

## Lab Assignment: Unit1_Ex3 (DB Emulator RESTful AJAX/PHP Web Service):

1.	Download the cis266_unit1_ex3.zip file from the Unit1 section of CIS266 Handouts
2.	Unzip cis266_unit1_ex3.zip and copy / paste the unit1_ex3 folder from the unzipped sample folder into your Apache’s CIS266\RESTful folder
3.	Test the links at localhost:8000/CIS266/RESTful/unit1_ex3 function properly & then analyze the sample code until you fully understand the PHP classes/testers/web service code provided
4.	Create a folder named LstF_Unit1_Ex3 (i.e., the path must be:  C:\wamp64\www\CIS266\Students\LstF_Unit1_Ex3)
5.	Copy / Paste unit1_ex3 folder’s files & subfolders into your new CIS266\Students\LstF_Unit1_Ex3 folder and modify the code so that all the links/apps work properly in your new directory
6.	Add a class property named publisher to the Product class and add/modify all PHP functions in the Product class, the ProductDB class, & the Product_API code to also process this new property.
7.	Modify your Web Service Client to also display the new property returned by the web service provider as innerHTML along with all the other service provider data displayed from the DB Emulator web service.

8.	Fully test that your new links/apps function & then capture sufficient inputs/outputs to demonstrate they work properly and paste them into a new Microsoft Word document and save the document as an industry standard .pdf document named LstF_Unit1_Ex3.pdf. Make sure to include the address bar in your captures!

9.	Zip up your LstF_Unit1_Ex3 folder into a file named LstF_Unit1_Ex3.zip and submit your .pdf file AND your .zip file as TWO SEPARATE FILES
