# CIS266
This is my coursework covering the class of Web Services. This includes PHP/Java/AJAX/AJAJ: RESTful and SOAP

## Structure / What is included / What is not included

#### Structure
The course is broken down into 4 units. Each unit contains 4 exercises. At the end of each unit there is a test. 

#### What is NOT included?
1. Tests. There will be no tests included in this. Besides I am sure the teachers are well aware of github and stackoverflow for people looking for an easy A and change the tests constantly.
2. MySQL DataBases. I used peoples names and ages. If the teacher gave us a DB to use, I will mention it for that Unit/Exercuse

#### So what is included?
1. My coursework. with some information being redacted. Mainly names.
2. Thats really it. Each units exercises, what else do you need? 

## Final Thoughts.... 
Most of this code comes from Murach's books(Well their "databases/class" examples), as that is what the teacher based it off. However, there is NO BOOK in relation to this material. There are books covering PHP, Java, JavaScrip, jQuery, but nothing covering it as a all-in-one. 

#### Books mentioned above: 
1. Coming Soon

#### Programs used:
1. Unit 1 - 2 I used Visual Studio Code. Normally I use Sublime Text 3, was giving VSCode a shot.
2. Unit 3 + We used IBM's WebShpere.. You can run Eclipse/IntilliJ Ultimate I'm sure.

## Ending
- If you find any issues, please feel free to help out. I am by no means a guru when it comes to this that is why I created this repo, to help out others who might be struggling.
- Take a moment to give a star if this was helpful to you in anyway. :-D
