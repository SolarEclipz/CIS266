This is my course work covering Web Services. This includes PHP/Java/AJAX/AJAJ

If you find any issues, please feel free to help out. I am by no means a guru when it comes to this.

Most of this code comes from Murach's books(Well their "databases/class" examples), as that is what the teacher based it off. However, there is
NO BOOK in relation to this material. There is books covering PHP, Java, JavaScrip, jQuery, but nothing covering it as a all-in-one.

Take a moment to give a star if this was helpful to you in anyway. :-D
